Hi Mario,

If you have no problem, I would like to continue our contact and tasks outside of fiverr. We can connect with any regular chatting apps like whatsApp, telegram, slack, etc. It will economical for both of us. Fiverr takes more 20% from me. That's why sometimes project's budget becomes high.

No worries, I trust you, you can pay me after getting your job ready. 

Please let me know your opinion. if it works fine for you, you may knock me at my mail: zbinsaifull@gmail.com 

Otherwise, we will continue in fiverr. 

Thanks
